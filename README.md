# Express IPGeolocation API Server

This project sets up an Express.js server that fetches geolocation data based on a client's IP address using the IPGeolocation API. It provides a simple endpoint `/api/hello` to greet visitors with their IP, city location, and a customizable greeting message.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```
````

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - `PORT`: Port number for the server to listen on.
   - `geoApiKey`: Your API key from IPGeolocation.io.

## Usage

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Access the API endpoint:

   ```
   GET http://localhost:{PORT}/api/hello?visitor_name=<visitor_name>
   ```

   Replace `{PORT}` with your configured port number.

3. **Parameters:**
   - `visitor_name` (optional): Visitor's name to personalize the greeting.

## Dependencies

- **express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **request-ip**: Middleware for retrieving the client's IP address.
- **axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to external APIs.

## Error Handling

- If the geolocation API request fails, the server responds with default values (IP, "Unknown" for location, and a generic greeting).

## Notes

- Customize `geoApiKey` with your own API key from IPGeolocation.io.
- Adjust the greeting message and handling as per your application's requirements.
