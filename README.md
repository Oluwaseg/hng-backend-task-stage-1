# Geolocation API

This project sets up a basic web server using Express.js, which provides an API endpoint to get the client's IP address, location, and current temperature based on their IP address. It uses the ipgeolocation.io API to fetch this information.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- An API key from [ipgeolocation.io](https://ipgeolocation.io/)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/geolocation-api.git
   cd geolocation-api
   ```
````

2. Install the required npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your ipgeolocation.io API key:

   ```env
   geoApiKey=YOUR_IPGEOLOCATION_API_KEY
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the welcome page.

3. Use the following API endpoint to get the client's IP address, location, and temperature:

   ```http
   GET /api/hello?visitor_name=yourname
   ```

   Example:

   ```http
   GET http://localhost:3000/api/hello?visitor_name=Mark
   ```

   Response:

   ```json
   {
     "client_ip": "8.8.8.8",
     "location": "Mountain View",
     "greeting": "Hello, Mark! The temperature is 15.4 degrees Celsius in Mountain View."
   }
   ```

## Code Explanation

- The server uses `express` to handle HTTP requests.
- The `request-ip` middleware is used to get the client's IP address.
- The `axios` library is used to make HTTP requests to the ipgeolocation.io API.
- The root route (`/`) serves a simple HTML page with links to the API endpoint.
- The `/api/hello` route handles GET requests, fetches the geolocation and weather data based on the client's IP address, and responds with a JSON object containing the IP address, location, temperature, and a greeting message.

## Important Notes

- If the server is accessed locally (e.g., `localhost`), the client's IP address will be `::1` or `127.0.0.1`. In such cases, the server uses Google's public DNS IP address `8.8.8.8` for demonstration purposes.
- The geolocation and weather data accuracy depends on the ipgeolocation.io API.
